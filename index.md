## About Me

I am a (mostly) self-taught web developer.  
I started learning JavaScript through the Hour of Code program in 2015 and have been passionate about learning computer science ever since. I studied computer science through Bob Jones University from 2017-2019 and am currently studying on my own, trying to get a web development job before finishing my bachelors degree. Outside of work, I enjoy expanding my collections of fun facts and flannel shirts, doing DIY projects, learning new things, and experimenting with food.

## Projects
